This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: creating a dangling pointer by modifying a vector after obtaining a raw pointer to its elements. The `bug.rs` file showcases the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version.  The original code attempts to modify the vector after obtaining a raw pointer, leading to undefined behavior. The solution uses safe methods, preventing this issue.
